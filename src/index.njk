    <h1>Helpful & Affordable Website Developer </h1>
    <p>
        Hello, I'm a website developer in the Santa Ana, California area. I've been working with computers for a couple decades now and in more recent years I've been building out websites. While my focus is mainly on helping people with their content management systems like WordPress I also make custom web applications from the bottom up. When I'm not helping someone out with their project I'm busy hanging out with my friends in the California outdoors or making web design resources that i share with the design community. Welcome to my website, please take a look around.
